What is this?
=============

This is a small collection of random snippets of vimscript I've written
while supporting users in #vim on freenode or on StackOverflow.  They
will be collected here for easier reference in the future.

Be Warned
---------

Please note that these scripts aren't 100% foolproof and are generally
just proof-of-concept demonstrations.  The goal here is merely to show
simple examples of what can be done in a few lines of vimscript.

You did something stupid, this is how it should have been done.
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to suggest an improved or simply improvised version of
any of these scripts I will gladly add alternatives and make sure you
are credited.
